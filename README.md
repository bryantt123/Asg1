NewJeans is a South Korean K-Pop girl group formed by ADOR, a company under Hybe Corporation. They consist of 5 members, Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. They debuted on July 22 in 2022, breaking multiple records for K-Pop girl group debuts in South Korea, mesmorising fans all over the globe for their visuals and music genre.

The purpose of this project is to give users a chance to know more about NewJeans and become long-time fans of the group. This is mainly to increase the popularity ranking of the group and the sales of albums and merchandise from the group.
